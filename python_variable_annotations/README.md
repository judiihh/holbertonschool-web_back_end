# Python Variable Annotations

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Type annotations in Python 3
* How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
* Duck typing
* How to validate your code with mypy

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* All your files must be executable
* All your modules should have documentation
* All your classes should have documentation
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation

## Tasks
### 0. Basic annotations - add
Write a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.
